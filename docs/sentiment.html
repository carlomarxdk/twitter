                The histogram of the sentiments of the tweets/descprtions can be found in Figure 1/2.
                The average for the Tweets is $\approx 5.20 \pm 0.34$, and for the profile descprtions: $\approx 5.54 \pm 0.63$.
              </p>
              <p>
                While the sentiment of the profile descriptions seems to be a little bit lower, the difference is inside the standard deviation, and therefore not significant.
                In general, the distribution of the profile descriptions is much broader, than the one for the tweet sentiments.
                However, this might be purely explained just by the fact, that the sample size for the descprtions is much lower.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the Tweet histogram, there are outliers at certain sentiment values.
                Those were removed, and to make those 2 distriutions directly compareable, both distributions were divided by ther maximum.
                The result can be seen in the following <a href = "./plots/hist_sentiment_tw_desc.html">figure</a>:

                In the following <a href = "./plots/average_sentiment_per_day.html">figure</a>, the average sentiments for the <b>troll</b> tweets, and for <b><a href="https://hedonometer.org/about.html">whole</a></b> twitter can be compared. (Not the whole of Twitter, but Twitterâ€™s Gardenhose feed, which represents approximately 10% of all Tweets.)
              </p>
              <div class="container-fluid py-1">
                  <iframe width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="./plots/average_sentiment_per_day.html"></iframe>
              </div>
            <p>
              Some differences in the 2 sentiment time series are immediately striking.
              Firstly, till April 2012, the day-to-day difference in the sentiments of the troll tweets is very high (i.e.: It jumps around a lot.)
              The reason being is, that the number of Tweets in the dataset for that timepriod is very low, therefore the day-to-day variance is also higher.
              The average sentiment/day over the whole period is $\approx 5.24 \pm 0.19$.
              Thats significantely lower than the average sentiment/days of the Gardenhose feed $\approx 6.02 \pm 0.04$.
              The average troll tweets is therefore significantely more negative, than the average Tweet.
            </p>

            <p>
              To make this plot more explorable and make it easier to compare changes in activity across both time series, they were <b>standardized</b>.
              So if $S(t)$ is the time series, the standardized version of the time series is $\bar{S}(t) = \left( S(t) - \text{avg}(S)\right)/\text{std}(S)$.
              This plot can be found in the following <a href = "./plots/norm_sentiment_per_day.html">figure</a>.
            </p>
              <div class="container-fluid py-1">
                  <iframe width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="./plots/norm_sentiment_per_day.html"></iframe>
              </div>
            <p>
              Whats also striking about the troll sentiments is, that there seem to be well defined time periods, when the sentiment is lower.
              For example, 10.May 2013 to 31.Jan 2014, the sentiment is about $0.15$ points lower than the sentiment before/after that time period.
              Another dropoff happens in the period from the 19.Oct 2015 to the 27.Dec 2015.
              This might be explained by specific operations of the <b>IRA</b> in that time periods.
