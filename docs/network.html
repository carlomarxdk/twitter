            The accounts have 11 different languages, of these are (language-code, with the according number of nodes):<code> [('ar',28), ('de',111), ('en',2286), ('en-gb', 11), ('es',194), ('fr',11), ('id',1), ('it',7), ('ru',1013), ('uk',2), ('zh-cn',3)]

              <p class="lead">
            The value for the modularity based on the languages is $\approx 0.08$.
            So while the modularity is still positive, it is still very small, especially compared to the modularity for the communities found using the louvain-algorithm: $\approx 0.43$.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            To get a sense of how good the languages correspond to the communities calculated through the louvain-algorithm, the confusion matrix was calculated (communities with less than 2 members were disregarded).
            For the 3 big language-communities, the following results were found:
            <p>
              <b>'de':</b> $98\%$ were in the same community.
              This further verifies that the community of german-troll accounts is very clustered and fairly disconnected from the rest of the troll-network.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>'en':</b> $55\%$ are in the same/biggest community.
              However, the rest is not spaced out evenly, but there is a seccond subcommunity forming with, and together they correspond to $66\%$ of the nodes with language 'en'.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>'es':</b> $44\%$ are member of the biggest community.
              However, there is a second, equally big community, which also has mostly just 'es' members, together they correspond to $75\%$ of the 'es'-nodes.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>'ru':</b> $43\%$ are member of the biggest community.
              However, this community is overlapping quiet a lot with a 'en'-community ($396$ nodes are 'ru' and $91$ are 'en'.)
              3 of the 4 other big 'ru' communites are also overlapping quiet a bit with 'en' communities, however, there is one community with $89$ members, that has only $7$ 'en' members.
            </p>

            <b>Conclusion</b>
            <p class="lead">
              The <b>'de'</b> (german) and the <b>'es'</b> (spanish) are quiet clustered, however, the <b>'en'</b>(english) and <b>'ru'</b>(russian) community are both quiet intertwined with each other.
              However, this might also be due to the fact, that they are the quiet a bit bigger than the german and spanish one.

                    <p class="lead"> It is also possible to show, that the network has got an underlying community structure by plotting the local clustering coefficient $C$ against the degree $k$ for each node, and than comparing this to a random network with the same degree-distribution (see figure 5).
